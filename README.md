# badireadyoverload
Slightly fixed i-ready overload for newer chrome. This is bad because theres a ton of errors, really, all I did was transfer it to manifest 3, I dont even know if i did THAT right. From what I've seen, ArjhanToteck created the original but then it got deleted? Credits if needed. Fuck you, I-Ready.
